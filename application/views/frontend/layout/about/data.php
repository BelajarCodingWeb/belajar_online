Over 2 million people around the world come to Code School to get started with a new technology and learn by doing.

<h3>The Inspiration</h3>

Coding skills have never been in higher demand, but traditional computer science courses are often costly, time consuming, and lack the flexibility many people demand. Meanwhile, technology is moving quicker than ever and to stay current, many developers must constantly be learning new skills outside of their day jobs. This has left room for new approaches to code education.

In our opinion, the best way to learn is by doing. Code School opens the door to a new way of learning by combining high-quality video, in-browser coding, and gamification to make learning fun!

<h3>Code School, a Pluralsight Company</h3>

Code School is now a Pluralsight company. Pluralsight is the global leader in online learning for professional software developers, IT specialists, and creative technologists.

Together, our goal is to democratize professional technology learning, making it more accessible to those around the world. As we grow, we will continue to seek those opportunities that will foster this cause and empower individuals and enterprises to truly embrace a culture of learning.
